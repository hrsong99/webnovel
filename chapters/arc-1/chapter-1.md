# Chapter 1

## Chapter Summary
- Jaemin dies in a mundane but bitterly ironic workplace accident and experiences the "handoff"—a cold, spec-like void between systems.
- He awakens in a weak body on a mountain path in Murim, disoriented and injured, with fragmented memories syncing.
- He assesses threats and resources like a developer scanning logs: terrain, injuries, clothing, nearby sounds—survival mode bootstraps.
- A tense encounter with distant bandit scouts forces him to move and mask his vulnerability without direct combat.
- A faint interface flicker and inaudible chime tease the presence of a System; a translucent cursor blinks—and the chapter ends.

## Character Actions & Developments
- Jaemin: Maintains composure under shock using diagnostic thinking; prioritizes information gathering; sets a survival baseline; acknowledges fear but frames it as latency to be amortized over action.
- Bandit Scouts (unnamed): Probe the path opportunistically; their presence signals the world's harsh social contract and informs Jaemin's immediate risk model.
- Environment (Murim): Functions almost as a character—thin mountain air, uneven paths, and cultural artifacts (saber marks on a tree, worn shrine) enrich context and constraints.

## Main Gain / Plot Progression
- Confirmation of death and reincarnation; first implicit confirmation of a governing "System." 
- Clear external threat introduced (bandits) without resolving it—stakes established.
- Jaemin's approach to problem-solving (debugging mindset) becomes the primary tool and tone-setter.

## Main Goal of the Chapter
- Onboard the reader into premise, tone, and survival constraints.
- Seed the System as a real but unreliable interface to be interrogated.
- End with a forward hook that promises an actionable tutorial in Chapter 2.

## Cliffhanger / Forward Hook
- A translucent status window almost renders; a cursor blinks with a soft, off-timing chime. Then: [Press any thought to continue].
