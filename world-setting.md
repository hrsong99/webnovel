## **Geography and The Central Plains (Ï§ëÏõê)** üó∫Ô∏è

The known world is dominated by a vast, continent-spanning Empire, colloquially known as the **Central Plains**. The geography is modeled after ancient China and Korea, featuring diverse climates and terrains.

* **The Yellow River**: The heart of the Empire, around which the most fertile lands and largest cities are clustered. This is the seat of Imperial power and the territory of the most influential Orthodox sects.
* **The Northern Wastes**: A cold, harsh land of steppes and tundra. It's sparsely populated, primarily by nomadic tribes and the Unorthodox Faction, who value its isolation.
* **The Western Highlands (ÊòÜ‰ªëÂ±±ËÑâ)**: A treacherous region of towering, cloud-piercing mountains, including the legendary Kunlun Mountains. The air here is thin but incredibly rich in Natural Ki. The Heavenly Demon Cult makes its main fortress, the **Heavenly Mountain (Ï≤úÏÇ∞)**, in this region, hoarding its dense spiritual energy.
* **The Southern Jungles (ÂçóÊûó)**: A humid, labyrinthine land of dense forests, swamplands, and exotic poisons. It's home to numerous strange Spiritual Beasts and is the domain of poison masters and the Nanman tribes.
* **The Eastern Coast**: A prosperous region of port cities and trade, heavily influenced by the **Five Great Families**, who control much of the Empire's wealth.

**Ki-Rich Territories** are the most contested lands in the world. These are places where Natural Ki is exceptionally dense, such as the peak of **Mount Hua (ÌôîÏÇ∞)**, the volcanic crater of the **Heavenly Mountain**, or the ancient forests of **Mount Song (Ïà≠ÏÇ∞)** where the Shaolin Temple resides. Control over these lands means faster cultivation and the ability to grow Spiritual Plants, making them vital strategic assets.

## **A Brief History of Power üìú**

The world's history is defined by the cyclical rise and fall of great powers, both Imperial and martial.

* **The Age of Chaos (500 years ago)**: Following the collapse of a previous dynasty, the land was fractured. Warlords and powerful martial artists carved out their own territories. This era was defined by brutal conflict and is when many of the most powerful martial arts were forged in the crucible of battle. It's also when "The Analyst," the creator of the Sutra, lived and died, disgusted by the endless cycle of violence.
* **The Rise of the Tianlong Empire (300 years ago)**: The first Tianlong Emperor, a brilliant strategist and a Peak-level master himself, unified the Central Plains. He established a pact with the burgeoning Orthodox Faction: the Emperor would rule the common people and the land, while the **Murim (Î¨¥Î¶º)** would govern themselves, existing as a parallel society with its own laws. This pact created a fragile balance.
* **The Great War of Righteousness and Demons (100 years ago)**: The Heavenly Demon Cult, having grown immensely powerful in the Western Highlands, launched a full-scale invasion of the Central Plains. The war lasted for a decade, costing millions of lives. It was a cataclysm that saw the destruction of countless sects and the rise of new legends. The Orthodox Faction, led by the Shaolin Temple and the Nine Great Sects, eventually pushed the Cult back but at a terrible cost.
* **The Fragile Peace (Present Day)**: For the last century, a tense peace has held. The pact between the Emperor and the Murim is strained, the Orthodox Faction is wary of the Demonic Cult's resurgence, and the common people are caught in the middle, often suffering the consequences of the martial world's "righteous" conflicts.

## **The Current Political Landscape üèõÔ∏è**

The world is ruled by three interconnected but often conflicting powers: The Imperial Court, the Orthodox Faction (the White Path), and the Unorthodox/Demonic Factions (the Black Path).

### **The Tianlong Empire and the Emperor**

The current Emperor is a shrewd but aging ruler. The Empire is vast and powerful, with a massive army of professional soldiers. However, an Imperial soldier, no matter how well-equipped, is no match for a Second-Rate or higher martial artist. The Emperor maintains control through:
* **The Imperial Decree**: He is the Son of Heaven, and his authority is absolute over the common populace and the bureaucracy.
* **The Golden Guard**: An elite force of eunuch masters loyal only to the Emperor. Their leader is a mysterious Peak-level expert.
* **Playing the Balance**: The Emperor secretly fuels the conflict between the Orthodox and Demonic factions, ensuring neither grows powerful enough to threaten his throne. He views the entire Murim as a necessary evil to be managed.

### **The Orthodox Faction (Ï†ïÌåå / Jeongpa) - The Murim Alliance**

Led by the **Murim Alliance (Î¨¥Î¶ºÎßπ)**, this is the dominant power in the Central Plains. They preach justice, honor, and order, but their actions are often driven by politics and the preservation of their own power.

* **The Nine Great Sects, One Gang (Íµ¨ÌååÏùºÎ∞© / Gupailbang)**:
    * **Shaolin Temple (ÏÜåÎ¶ºÏÇ¨)**: The undisputed leader of the Orthodox Faction. Located on Mount Song, their martial arts are profound, and they are seen as the ultimate arbiters of justice. Their Abbot is one of the few known Transcendent masters in the world.
    * **Wudang Sect (Î¨¥ÎãπÌåå)**: The second pillar, masters of Tai Chi and Taoist principles. Known for their calm demeanor and flowing sword arts.
    * **Mount Hua Sect (ÌôîÏÇ∞Ìåå)**: Famous for their dazzling Plum Blossom Sword Art. The "Sword Saint" from the prologue is their most legendary figure.
    * *...and six other major sects (Emei, Kunlun, etc.)*
    * **The Beggars' Sect (Í∞úÎ∞©)**: The "One Gang." Not a traditional sect, but a massive network of beggars and informants that spans the entire Empire. Their information network is second to none.

* **The Five Great Families (Ïò§ÎåÄÏÑ∏Í∞Ä / Odesega)**:
    * Powerful martial clans that rule through lineage, wealth, and influence. They often intermarry with the Imperial Court and the Great Sects.
    * **Namgung Clan (ÎÇ®Í∂ÅÏÑ∏Í∞Ä)**: The most powerful of the families, known for their tyrannical and powerful blade techniques. The "Blade King" from the prologue was their previous patriarch.
    * **Zhuge Clan (Ï†úÍ∞àÏÑ∏Í∞Ä)**: Not known for their martial prowess, but for their unparalleled strategic minds and formation tactics.
    * *...and three other influential families (Hwangbo, Moyong, etc.)*

### **The Unorthodox and Demonic Factions (ÏÇ¨Ìåå / ÎßàÍµê)**

These groups represent the "dark" side of the Murim, valuing power and freedom above all else.

* **The Heavenly Demon Cult (Ï≤úÎßàÍµê / Cheonmagyo)**:
    * The ultimate enemy of the Orthodox Faction. Based in the treacherous Heavenly Mountain, they are a highly structured, fanatical organization dedicated to conquering the Central Plains.
    * Their leader, the **Heavenly Demon (Ï≤úÎßà)**, is a figure of absolute terror, a master whose power is said to rival the Abbot of Shaolin. The position is passed down through a brutal trial where the strongest disciple kills their master and takes their place.
    * Their martial arts are devastatingly powerful but carry the immense risk of **Qi Deviation**.

* **The Unorthodox Faction (ÏÇ¨Ìåå / Sapa)**:
    * Not a single entity, but a loose collection of sects, clans, and individuals who reject the hypocrisy of the Orthodox Faction.
    * This includes the **Blood Sect** (known for devouring arts), the **Poison Valley Clan**, various assassin guilds, and powerful mercenary groups. They are pragmatic and often fight amongst themselves as much as they fight the Orthodox Faction.

### **The Current Historical Context: A Brewing Storm**

The story begins in an era of **precarious balance**.

* **A Power Vacuum**: The legends of the previous generation, like the Sword Saint and the Blade King, are aging or dead. Their duel near Clear Stream Village was one of the last gasps of that era. A new generation of ambitious warriors is rising, eager to make their mark, leading to increased friction and "righteous" duels that spill over into the common world.
* **The Demonic Cult's Resurgence**: After a century of rebuilding, the Heavenly Demon Cult is stirring once more. Their spies have infiltrated the Central Plains, and skirmishes along the western border are becoming more frequent.
* **Imperial Scheming**: The Emperor sees this as an opportunity. He secretly hopes for a limited war to bleed the Murim of its strength, allowing his own Imperial power to grow.
* **The People's Suffering**: For the common person, life is increasingly difficult. They are taxed by the Empire and terrorized by the collateral damage of the Murim's conflicts. Bandits, many of whom are disgraced martial artists, plague the roads. There is a growing, unspoken resentment towards the powerful warriors who treat the world as their personal playground.

This is the world Jin Cheol steps into‚Äîa world teetering on the brink of another great war, rife with hypocrisy and suffering, and perfectly primed for a revolutionary who seeks not to rule it, but to **abolish it entirely**.
