## Chapters

### Chapter 1: Awakening in Murim

#### Chapter Summary

- Jaemin regains consciousness at the edge of a dangerous hunting ground, injured and alone.

- Treating the System like faulty software, he probes cooldowns and state transitions.
- He exploits a timing bug to misdirect the beast and escape to temporary shelter.
- He documents observations and drafts his first rules for safe testing of System behavior.

#### Character Actions & Developments

- **Jaemin:** Assesses threats, debugs System prompts under stress, sets up safe-test heuristics, escapes using an AI timing exploit; shifts from panic to disciplined analysis and reframes the world as a system to be understood and improved.
- **Local Villager (cameo):** Provides terse directions to an abandoned shed; hints at nearby sect politics.

#### Main Gain / Plot Progression

First validated evidence that the System's logic can be observed, tested, and exploited safely in the field.

#### Main Goal of the Chapter

Survive the initial encounter while establishing a repeatable methodology for investigating the System.

#### Cliffhanger / Forward Hook

As Jaemin rests, a glitched notification flickers: "Unhandled exception: RuleCheck timeout." He decides to seek structured knowledge at a nearby sect.
