#### Characters

##### Key Actions

- **Jaemin:** Assesses threats, debugs System prompts under stress, sets up safe-test heuristics, escapes using an AI timing exploit.
- **Local Villager (cameo):** Provides terse directions to an abandoned shed, hinting at nearby sect politics.

##### Character Development / Changes

- **Jaemin:** Shifts from panic to disciplined analysis; reframes the world as a system to be understood and improved.

##### Primary Dialogue (Excerpt)

> "If you're going to pretend to be code, I'll treat you like codeâ€”breakpoints and all." - Jaemin

#### Main Gain / Plot Progression

First validated evidence that the System's logic can be observed, tested, and exploited safely in the field.

#### Main Goal of the Chapter

Survive the initial encounter while establishing a repeatable methodology for investigating the System.

#### Cliffhanger / Forward Hook
