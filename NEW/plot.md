#### **Part 1: The Cataclysm of Righteousness (Chapters 1-5)**

* **Protagonist:** Jin Cheol (진철 / 眞鐵), the son of a village blacksmith in the remote Clear Stream Village (청계촌). He is 19 years old, intelligent, diligent, and physically strong from his trade but has no martial arts training or notable Ki sensitivity. His world is small and happy: his craft, his loving parents, and his fiancée, Yeon-hwa (연화), the weaver's daughter.
* **The Inciting Incident:** The peace is shattered by the arrival of two living legends of the Orthodox Faction (정파): the **"Sword Saint of Mount Hua" (화산검성)** and the **"Blade King of the Namgung Clan" (남궁세가 도왕)**. Their duel is not one of malice, but of "principle"—a decade-long debate on the ultimate nature of the sword versus the blade, to be settled under the heavens.
* **A Spectator's Hell:** The duel is described not as a thrilling action sequence, but as a terrifying, incomprehensible natural disaster. The air shimmers and cracks. Sword Qi (검기) and Blade Energy (도기) scar the landscape. The villagers, including Jin Cheol and his family, are frozen in awe and terror. They are ants watching a battle between gods.
* **The Aftermath:** A single, deflected wave of energy—a mere afterthought for the duelists—careens into the village. It strikes Jin Cheol’s home and workshop. The explosion is absolute. His parents and Yeon-hwa, who was visiting, are instantly vaporized. Jin Cheol only survives because he was at the edge of the property, quenching a newly forged axehead. He is thrown back, his body broken and burned.
* **The Hollow Apology:** The duel ends in a respectful draw. The masters descend. They see the destruction, the weeping villagers, and the catatonic Jin Cheol. The Sword Saint offers a solemn, detached pronouncement: *"It is regrettable that the path to enlightenment requires sacrifice. Their deaths in the presence of such martial truth is a form of honor."* They leave a pouch of gold—an insult—and depart, their minds already on their next moment of insight. This moment cements Jin Cheol’s hatred. It's not for them as individuals, but for the entire system that deems his family's lives as meaningless "sacrifice."

#### **Part 2: The Weight of a Vow (Chapters 6-12)**

* **The Survivor's Guilt:** Jin Cheol slowly recovers physically, nursed by the grieving villagers. But his spirit is dead. He spends weeks staring at the crater where his life used to be. The gold coins sit untouched. He realizes the futility of conventional justice. No magistrate would dare issue a warrant for the Sword Saint. No Murim Alliance elder would punish their own pillars.
* **The Forging of a Will:** At the makeshift grave for his family, Jin Cheol makes a vow. He will not seek simple revenge. Killing those two men would change nothing; new masters would rise. He vows to eradicate the very foundation of Murim. He will become a plague to the world of martial artists, dismantling their sects, burning their manuals, and shattering their pride until the world forgets the meaning of "Jianghu" (강호). He will bring about the sunset of their age.
* *Insight Moment #1:* His first 깨달음 is not about martial arts, but philosophy. He realizes: *"Power is not the problem. The *pursuit* of power is the poison. A world that worships strength will always sacrifice the weak at its altar."*
* **A Futile Search:** Driven by this cold fire, he spends the next two years on a desperate journey. He tries to join sects, but his age (he's now over 20) and lack of innate talent get him rejected everywhere. He works as a laborer, a guard, listening to stories in taverns, trying to find a path—any path—to power. This period emphasizes his absolute powerlessness and the impenetrable walls of the Murim world. He is constantly reminded of his status as an outsider, an ant.

#### **Part 3: The Repository of Heresy (Chapters 13-25)**

* **A Whisper of a Path:** Jin Cheol hears a rumor about the **"Repository of Forgotten Wills" (망념의 서고)**, a cursed library hidden in the treacherous Black Wind Mountains (흑풍산). It is said to house the works of heretics, madmen, and scholars who tried to defy the principles of Murim. The Orthodox Faction has declared it a forbidden zone. For Jin Cheol, the enemy of his enemy is his only hope.
* **The Trial of the Mind:** The Repository is not guarded by powerful warriors, but by the obsessions of its dead master. The entrance is a complex puzzle lock requiring the logic of a craftsman. The interior is a maze that tests one's will, forcing intruders to relive their worst memories. Jin Cheol's trauma nearly breaks him, but his singular, cold purpose acts as an anchor. He passes the trial not through strength, but through his unyielding conviction.
* **The Legacy of the Analyst:** He finds the life's work of a genius scholar from 500 years ago, known only as "The Analyst" (분석가). The Analyst believed Ki was a cosmic flaw, a source of imbalance. He dedicated his life not to cultivating it, but to understanding its structure to neutralize it. Jin Cheol finds his magnum opus: a manual titled **"The Sutra of Unraveling Principles" (해리심경 / 解理心經)**.
* **The Sutra's Power:** This is not a conventional martial art.
    * **Foundation:** It teaches the user to cultivate a formless, neutral Ki called "Solvent Qi" (해기 / 解氣). This Qi is weak offensively but has a unique property: it can analyze and break down the structure of other forms of internal energy.
    * **Progression:** Growth is not about accumulating more power, but achieving deeper levels of *understanding*. Its "levels" are framed as academic achievements:
        1.  **Perception (감지 / 感知):** The ability to see the flow of Ki in others.
        2.  **Analysis (분석 / 分析):** The ability to understand a technique's structure, its strengths, and its flaws after seeing it once.
        3.  **Interference (간섭 / 干涉):** The ability to use Solvent Qi to disrupt another's technique, causing it to stutter or fail.
        4.  **Deconstruction (해체 / 解體):** (This would be a far-future goal) The ability to permanently break down a person's cultivated Ki, effectively crippling them as a martial artist.
* *Insight Moment #2:* While meditating on the Sutra, Jin Cheol has his second 깨달음, linking the art to his past as a blacksmith. *"A sword has a grain, a balance point, and hidden flaws from the forging. Internal energy is no different. One does not need to shatter the mountain to break the stone; one only needs to find the crack."*

#### **Part 4: The First Crack in the Foundation (Chapters 26-30)**

* **The First Student:** After five years of secluded, obsessive training, Jin Cheol has mastered the first level (Perception) and is beginning the second (Analysis). He is now 26. He has the constitution of a Third-Rate (삼류) warrior, but his true abilities are hidden.
* **The Target:** He leaves the mountains and learns of the "Iron Axe Bandits," led by a disgraced, brutal Second-Rate (이류) practitioner from a righteous sect. They are a microcosm of everything he hates: a product of the "righteous" world, now preying on the common people they were meant to protect. They become his first test.
* **The Climax of the Arc:** Jin Cheol confronts the bandit leader not with a challenge, but with an offer to serve him. He spends a week in their camp, silently observing. During the climactic confrontation, he doesn't use a grand technique. As the bandit leader attacks, Jin Cheol, with his Perception, sees the flawed flow of energy in his Axe Art—a slight imbalance when transitioning from one move to the next.
* **The Battle:** Using a simple iron rod, Jin Cheol doesn't block the axe. He taps a precise point on the leader's wrist at the exact moment of the flaw. The leader's powerful technique collapses catastrophically. His internal energy goes into disarray, causing him to cough up blood and his meridians to seize up. The invincible leader is defeated by a single, seemingly weak tap. The remaining bandits are terrified into submission.
* **The End of the Beginning:** Jin Cheol does not become a hero. He takes the bandits' ill-gotten wealth, tells them to scatter and never be seen again, and melts back into the shadows. He leaves behind a single, chilling rumor that spreads through the underworld: a quiet, scholarly man who can "unmake" a warrior without throwing a single punch. He has his first victory, his first funds, and a confirmation of his path. The blacksmith's son is dead. **The Abolitionist** has taken his first step.

**End of Arc 1.** The stage is now set for Arc 2, where Jin Cheol will use his resources and unique abilities to infiltrate the deeper structures of the Murim world, seeking out the cracks in the great sects and powerful clans to begin his life's work of dismantlement.
