# Glossary

## About This Glossary

This glossary tracks recurring in‑world terminology, techniques, and symbols used across Arc 1. Korean terms appear in Hangul first, optionally followed by an English gloss. Romanized names follow Revised Romanization for consistency (e.g., Yoon Se‑jin, Jang Hyeon).

## Terms

| Term (KO) | Romanization/EN | Definition / Usage | First Notable Use |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 역문 | reverse gate | A misalignment pattern where breath timing “reverses,” causing reflexes (e.g., tongue‑palate touch) to double and flow to flip at the chest. Central to the legendary “incurable” affliction. | content/arc-1/chapter-6.md:33 |
| 혀끝/입천장 | tongue tip/palate cue | A procedural cue Se‑jin uses to retime reflex arcs; one controlled touch can reroute breath safely, while habitual double‑touch can trigger 역문. | content/arc-1/chapter-4.md:33 |
| 짧게, 짧게, 길게 | short, short, long | Baseline breath cadence used during diagnostics and crisis coordination (also shared via bells). | content/arc-1/chapter-1.md:?? |
| 철패 | iron emblem | A cold iron token bearing an offset double‑circle with a dividing line; clue to a trafficking network for techniques. | content/arc-1/chapter-1.md:?? |
| 문양 | emblem mark | The visual motif on items/ledgers; appears in simplified form on an incense supplier’s seal. | content/arc-1/chapter-6.md:45 |
| 은문 | silver script (spacing) | Hidden indexing system encoded in the spacing between strokes/lines; used for sealed Orthodox records. | content/arc-1/chapter-3.md:29 |
| 의술 중립 헌장 | medical neutrality charter | A pact recognizing treatment neutrality, non‑interference, and unconditional protection. | content/arc-1/chapter-9.md:9 |

## Editorial Notes

- Use Hangul in prose when characters speak/think in‑world; in outlines, include concise English glosses as needed.
- Keep “역문” untranslated in prose; add (reverse gate) on first mention in paratext.
- Use consistent hyphenation for names (e.g., Se‑jin, not Sejin).
